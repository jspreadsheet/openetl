# OpenETL

## Overview

**OpenETL** is a free, lightweight, and flexible ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework built in TypeScript, designed for developers who need a simple yet powerful tool to orchestrate data workflows in Node.js environments. With a modular architecture, OpenETL enables easy integration with various data sources and sinks—such as databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) and APIs (e.g., HubSpot)—through a consistent adapter-based approach.

### Key Features

- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Leverage TypeScript’s strong typing for defining connectors, transformations, and pipelines, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience.
- **Extensible Adapters**: Easily connect to diverse systems with pre-built or custom adapters, supporting both download and upload operations.
- **Data Transformation**: Apply a variety of built-in transformations (e.g., renaming keys, concatenating fields) or extend with custom logic.
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Define and execute data pipelines with configurable scheduling, error handling, and rate limiting.
- **Lightweight Footprint**: Minimal dependencies and a focus on simplicity make it ideal for small to medium-scale data projects or as a foundation for larger systems.

OpenETL is open-source under the [MIT License](LICENSE), empowering developers to extract data, transform it efficiently, and load it into target systems—all within a single, cohesive framework. Whether you’re syncing CRM data, managing database migrations, or building custom ETL processes, OpenETL provides the tools to get the job done with minimal overhead.
