# OpenETL Github Adapter

## Overview

**OpenETL** is a free, lightweight, and flexible ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework built in TypeScript, designed for developers who need a simple yet powerful tool to orchestrate data workflows in Node.js environments. With a modular architecture, OpenETL enables easy integration with various data sources and sinks—such as databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) and APIs (e.g., HubSpot)—through a consistent adapter-based approach.
